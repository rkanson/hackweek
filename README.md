# Pantheon HackWeek 2020
## Decoupled + SSG Support for Pantheon Sites

As sites evolve, more and more developers are looking to de-couple their front-ends from their backends, whether by SPA's or SSG (Statically Generated Sites). This is done for a multitude of reasons.

This project aims to complete the following:
- Build sites (statically or run the process needed (run node, php, ruby etc)
 - Compile assets (some processes may do this within the tool runner), image optim, minification, concat, etc.
- Deploy to the platform (via Kube)
- Deploy serverless functions to the Platform (via Kube)
